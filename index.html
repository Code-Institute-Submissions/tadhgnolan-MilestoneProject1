            <p>
              <span class="capital">A</span> young girl in her 20s, was telling
              her friend that finally after a brief explanation from a coworker,
              she learned how to make a coffee and at least that day she kind of
              liked the job. She learned how to use the expresso coffee machine
              and to make the basics brews: expresso and americano.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Those are the easy ones, but then comes the milk and that's a
              different thing 'cause steaming the milk changes the texture and
              temperature of the liquid, you do it wrong and the result can be
              very frothy, or too hot... so it is not just a matter of putting
              the steamer into the milk jug. To teach how to make latte,
              capuccino and flat white, needs more supervision, patience and
              time.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After a short time training, the girl was left alone, taking
              customers and making coffees. She was a bit surprised by this fact
              not only because she felt she didn't have the expertise, but also
              because she had just started the day before. Anyhow, instead of
              complaining or talking to the coworker, she carried on, doing the
              best she could.

              The puddle
            </h2>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="capital">A</span> guy has been working for 2 years as
              assistant manager in a bar. One day he noticed a leak from one of
              the pipes. He reported the problem to the manager who said he
              would sort it out, but time passed by, water drops kept falling
              and the guy kept reminding him about it.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              One day the assistant manager was getting things ready before
              opening time and when he finished going down the stairs he stepped
              in the puddle and slipped down onto his back. He tried to get up
              but he couldn’t. His phone was ok, so he rang the manager, told
              him what happened and the answer was: I’m busy, I cannot go now.
              The guy cleary stated the fact he couldn’t get up and described
              the intensity of the pain, but his boss didn’t change his mind.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The assistant manager called his girlfriend, while she was on the
              way, he crawled upstairs. She waited about 20 minutes outside
              'till her boyfriend, on all fours, was able to open the door. The
              ambulance didn’t take too long. At the hospital the diagnosis was
              a severe injury. For 2 months the guy couldn’t walk normally,
              straighten his back, nor was he able to lift any weight.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              When he returned to work he quit, sued the manager, won the case
              and compensation far greater than the cost of simply repairing the
              leak.

            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="capital">I</span>n an ice cream shop with all sorts
              of customers, a young man with a certain addiction to drugs, was a
              fan of milkshakes. More than once a week he was in front of the
              fridge trying the many ice cream flavours, it was hard for him to
              make up his mind, he liked them all.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              He always paid, he never complained not even about the price, he
              was kind and respectful, nevertheless out of the 4 or 5 employees,
              only one used to take him because the other ones avoided him.
            </p>
            <b></b>
            <p>
              On one occasion he didn't have enough money and was worried
              because the ice cream flavour chosen was popular and there wasn’t
              much left. The girl reassured him. The young man left promising he
              would be back.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Half an hour later he was there, money in hand. She prepared the
              order, he thanked her and even offered a tip, she smiled and
              denied. He insisted but she convinced him by recommending him to
              save it for the next milkshake. He thanked her again “you are the
              best” said, then sipping his drink waved at her and left the shop
              with a big smile.

            <h3>Smell the smoke</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span class="capital">I</span>n a food market, a girl who works
              frying food requests a extractor fan because of the smoke, the
              fumes and every time while working there she ends up with strong
              headaches, itchy eyes and more often she suffers fatigue. The
              owner tells her not to worry because the issue will be resolved.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Weeks after, there's no sign of the fan extractor. The girl brings
              the matter up again to the owner and he excuses himself by blaming
              the technician who never showed up. A couple of weeks later, the
              girl goes to the manager who advises her not to talk about this
              with the owner and that from now on she would look after the
              issue.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>The girl never asked again about it and eventually she quit.</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              After sometime other employees raised the problem about the smoke
              and requested a fan extractor without any success. What happened
              next was that one day, while working with customers queueing, a
              staff member, under 18 years of age, just fainted. For the young
              one’s mother it was too much to tolerate and she had words with
              the owner.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              But the extractor fan wasn't installed, not even after what
              transpired.

            <p>
              <span class="capital">T</span>he place opened before 7:00 am and
              from that moment on the early birds pop in for breakfast. Most of
              the clients are regulars, the deli assistant doesn’t know all of
              them yet and still she gets a bit nervous when seeing a “new
              face”, like the one that just arrived asking for a baguette with
              butter and bacon, but instead of bacon the man said rashers. She
              didn’t catch it immediately, she apologized and the man said it
              again: RASHERRRS. The girl finished the order wishing a good day
              to the customer that walked away without any goodbye.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Once the rush hour ended, the manager came to the girl, saying the
              man had complained because she speaks lowly and English wasn’t her
              mother tongue. The girl was expecting the manager to give out to
              her but instead he backed her up, telling the customer they liked
              a multicultural environment. He added that despite her shyness she
              was a good worker and as everyone once did, she was also starting
              in a new place.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The girl thanked the manager, he smiled back telling her not to be
              afraid of raising her voice and to trust more in herself the same
              way they trusted her.
